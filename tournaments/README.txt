These are the scripts I used to generate the Elo ratings at

Uses Python2 plus BayesElo

Setup: need to create separate subfolders for each time limit you want to run, to store SGF files and CSV files.

Also need a subfolder called command_lines with one file for each bot you want to run.

Read the comments in the python scripts for more details.
